Our Project Name:
    Trading System

Description Of Our Project:

    About:

    This trading system will allow users to create a new account, login in and look for items to trade.
    Users can make a one-way trade, where they lend someone item or borrow an item.
    Users can also make a two-way trade where both users borrow and lend an item.
    Each trade can be permanent or temporary. With a permanent trade, only one meeting will be created
    where the user gives away an item or borrows an item permanently. With a temporary trade, two meetings
    will be created where the second exchange will happen exactly one month after the first meeting in the
    same location. Users can edit or confirm the time and place to meet in real life to trade items.






    







Things you should know before running this program:

    - To run our program properly, make phase 1 the root or change the build configurations (add the “\phase1” to
      the end of the working directory)

    - You can create a regular user by going to the main menu create account option.
      See “RegularUserUsernameAndPassword.csv” for the users that already exist in the system and
      for the username, password, and email information about the user you created

    - you can add an admin user to the system by logging in as an admin user (see “AdminUserUsernameAndPassword.csv”)
      for username and passwords and going to the Others submenu where you should see the option to add another admin
      user

    - In “RegularUserUsernameAndPassword.csv” or “AdminUserUsernameAndPassword.csv”, each line is in the following format
      and corresponds to one user: username, password, email

    - In some places of our program that asks for input(ex. associates with ids or other information), it will only stop
    until you enter the correct/valid input. We will improve on that for phase 2. But for now, please bear with it.
