    Trading System

Description Of Our Project:

    About:

    This trading system will allow users to create a new account, login in and look for items to trade.
    Users can make a one-way trade, where they lend someone item or borrow an item.
    Users can also make a two-way trade where both users borrow and lend an item.
    Each trade can be permanent or temporary. With a permanent trade, only one meeting will be created
    where the user gives away an item or borrows an item permanently. With a temporary trade, two meetings
    will be created where the second exchange will happen exactly one month after the first meeting in the
    same location. Users can edit or confirm the time and place to meet in real life to trade items.
